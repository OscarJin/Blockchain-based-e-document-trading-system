# Blockchain-based E-document Trading System
Based on the platform of ETF, the project establishes the core transactional function through smart contract technology. Based on the different characteristics of transaction of copyright and reading rights, different right verifications and transaction logics are built. The core functions of transaction system construction, transaction logic design, transaction contract deployment and transaction process verification are realized. Finally, the project discusses a special electronic document encryption and reading program realizing real-time communication between itself and the dynamic privilege information of block chain, which solves the problem of illegal transmissions and copies of electronic documents to a certain extent.

The repository includes a JSON file to initialize your private network of blockchains, a smart contract file, based on Solidity and a bash to start a private network.

What's more, the TeX version of the report is updated, waiting for global developers to make it better.
